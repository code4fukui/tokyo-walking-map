Koshin-zuka pillar,"Koshin pillars (Koshin-zuka) <br>Koshin pillars were built in the hope of preventing epidemics and for long life based on Koshin belief in Taoism in China. The belief became popular among ordinary people in the Edo Period and the pillars were erected. In Taoism, it was believed that the ""three worms"" or evil spirits, living in the human body report their host's sins to heaven while the host is sleeping and shorten the host's life on Kanoesaru day that occurs every 60 days. There was the ritual of waiting for Koshin, or ""Koshin machi"", where people would stay up all night. At this Koshin pillar along the Edo-kaido Road, the Koshin machi ritual was held every year, and flowers are displayed still now.

Intake facility of Fuchu irrigation channel,"Fuchu irrigation channel is an approx. 6 km-long agricultural water channel. Water taken from the Tamagawa River at Aoyagi located downstream of Hinobashi-bridge and spring water from Aoyagi and Tachikawa Cliff Line are mixed in the channel, used for rice and crop fields in Kunitachi and Fuchu, and flow into Tamagawa River at Koremasa. It was previously called Shichika-mura (seven villages) irrigation (Kamiyabo, Shimoyabo, Aoyagi, Koremasa and Fuchu three shuku (post station town) ). It is presumed that the channel was developed by digging out the old flow passage of the old Tamagawa River in the early Edo period or mid-17th century. Along with urbanization, demand for irrigation fell, and most of the channel was converted to a closed conduit system on the Fuchu side. Only some parts of the channel remain as an open conduit on the Kunitachi side, which retains the old landscape of forest village. The intake facility of the Fuchu irrigation channel, constructed in 1900, is a large-scale, concrete structure with four sluice gates made of granite on the water intake side. It is opened in late May every year and closed when rice harvesting finishes in late September. There is a Yabo weir downstream of the channel, where the irrigation channel is divided into the main stream and Yabo branch flow, and further divided into small branches to irrigate the rice fields in the area. The open conduit part of the channel in Kunitachi has been selected as one of the 100 fine canals by Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in 2006, the only one selected in Tokyo.<br><br><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4hGbblEmdfVR8kwkarTNhApAzlzPZyM-nznHkLVTyqX14YI51QcvdJNvzUvorBUH9kYyk9NIwiBAORG8ZepITsbgh17w_qv5q6cqV6kDakIRdw3YBEs5Rdxl"" height=""200"" width=""auto"" />",35.682116,139.420165

Nobidome Yosui Hotaru-no-Sato,"Nobidome Yosui is an irrigation canal, which was built in 1655 by Matsudaira Nobutsuna, a feudal lord of Kawagoe Domain. Entering into the Showa period (from the late 1920s), the water pollution and water shortages accompanying rapid urbanization meant water diversion was suspended. Clear streams were, however, restored in 1984 under a clean waters project of the Tokyo Metropolitan areas and Saitama Prefecture. In Higashiyamato City, heike-botaru (luciola lateralis) were nurtured using part of the irrigation waters and it is possible to enjoy the sight of these every year from mid-May through June.

Azuma-bashi Bridge,"Located on Kaminarimon-dori Ave., this was the last bridge built on the Sumida-gawa River during the Edo period (1774). At the time, it was called Okawa-bashi Bridge, but the name was changed to Azumabashi when it was rebuilt in 1876. At one time, a ferry crossing known as ""Takecho no Watashi Crossing” was found in this area.",35.7101907,139.7987941
Komagata-bashi Bridge,"Located on Asakusa-dori Ave., the bridge name comes from Komagata-do on western side of the bridge. Komagata-do is said to have been built after the Kannon statue of Senso-ji Temple was retrieved in this area. Once, there was a ferry crossing in this area called “Komagata no Watashi Crossing”.",35.7082815,139.7973957
Umaya-bashi Bridge,"Located on Kasuga-dori Ave., the bridge name comes from the fact that there was a stable for pack horses carrying rice for Edo shogunate rice storehouses. It was first built in 1874. Once, this area was called “Onmaigashi Onmai riverbank,” and there was a ferry crossing called “Onmai no Watashi Crossing” on those riverbanks.",35.7043411,139.795135
Kuramae-bashi Bridge,"Located on the Kuramae-bashi-dori Ave., the bridge name comes from the name of the area. The area name Kuramae comes from the fact that there were Edo shogunate rice storehouses in Osaka, Kyoto, and Asakusa,  called the Mitsuokura Storehouses, and the ""Asakusa Okura Storehouse"" was located in this area. At one time, a ferry crossing known as “Fujimi no Watashi Crossing” was found in this area.",35.7009869,139.7933412
Yanagi-bashi Bridge,"The oldest record concerning the construction of the bridge is from 1698. Because it is in a location where the Kanda-gawa River flows into the Sumida-gawa River, at first it was called Kawaguchi Deguchi no Hashi (Bridge at the river mouth). The most persuasive theory is that the name of the bridge comes from the willow tree along the approach to the bridge. Once, Yanagibashi was a famous district for Geisha. It was mentioned as “Haru no yoru ya onna mikaeru Yanagibashi (Yanagibashi looking back on spring nights and women)” in a poem by Masaoka Shiki.",35.6952253,139.7874591
Asakusabashi,"Located on Edo-dori Ave., “Asakusa Gomon Gate” was once found here, the entrance to the center of Edo from the Oushu Kaido road. This gate was one of the 36 that protected Edo Castle. At the same time of the gate’s construction, Mitsuke-bashi Bridge was built. It is said that the bridge came to be called “Asakusa-bashi Bridge” after the “Asakusa Gomon Gate.”",35.695877,139.785418
Saemon-bashi Bridge,"Located on Saemon-bashi-dori Ave., the bridge name comes from the fact that there was the residence of Saemon no Jo Sakai, lord of the Shonai Domain in this area, and this area along the Kanda-gawa River was known as the Saemon riverbanks. It was first built in in the early Meiji period.",35.6965584,139.7827277
